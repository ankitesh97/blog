I'm a Software Engineer. I have completed my Btech in computer science from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute(VJTI,Mumbai).

I'm interested in all aspects of programming, with my primary interests laying a broad areas of programming languages, algorithms and machine learning. I would like to consider myself a good thinker. I enjoy thinking and use it to build complex algorithms, state of the art machine learning models, or to develop a tool which make the user's lives easier.
